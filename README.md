# noaycord

> This library's purpose is purely educational and if you wanna make a Discord bot with Python I would suggest using a library like discord.py. If you still wanna use the library follow the instructions in the **Using noaycord** section.

Hey y'all! Welcome to my Discord API library written in Python! I'm doing it just for fun and I'm looking to see if I can develop a library like that with no or little help.

## Using noaycord

As of now, the library is not on PyPI/pip, so you must download the source code with the green **Code** button on the page, then Download ZIP. Once it's downloaded, extract it into a folder called noaycord and you're done! Now whenever you want to use to use the library in a project, paste the noaycord folder into your working directory and you can add `import noaycord` into your Python project.

## Future

I know this will probably remain an unfinished project or a barely functional one, so let's not get my hopes up ^_^

## Contributions

If anyone wants to help in developing this, feel free to fork and make a pull request. If I see your code fit it will get merged into master.
